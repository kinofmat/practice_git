# practice_git
This is a a little project I am working on to help get more practice with both python syntax, and using git. 

I am using Visual Studio Code, but without the built in capabilities with github. Instead I was using powershell with the commands of git add, commit, push, pull, etc. I used these frequently when working on the project so I could become more familiar, even when I didn't necessarily needed to pull or add and commit. I also created a little error that I had to correct with version control.

In the python code I created a simple game of rock, paper, scissors. I explored how to use a random generated variable in Python. I also implimented the code to do a best out of three and then ask the user if they want to have another match against the computer.
